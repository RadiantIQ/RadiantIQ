The project consists in a platform providing a better learning experience for scientific subjects. The idea is to include standard formal explanations of topics (with associated exercises) accompanied by a small number of interactive minigames. To better involve the students, each exercise will be put in an AI generated context (e.i. a phisics problem related to speeds and distances could be told using the story of Achilles and the turtoise). Moreover, the formal explanations can be genrated by an AI, uploaded by a professor or by a combination of the two. Lastly, AI is used to suggest which topics should be revised for the students using the platform.
